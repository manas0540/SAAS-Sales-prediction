An end-to-end ML pipeline for SaaS analytics that processes 13,000+ records, cleans high-missing-value data, engineers business features, visualizes churn and revenue trends, and builds models to forecast subscription duration and revenue, enabling early churn detection and smarter pricing, retention, and business decisions for sustainable growth and impact.

Project Overview — End-to-End Data Science Pipeline

This project represents a complete end-to-end data science and machine learning workflow built on a dataset of more than 13,000 SaaS subscription records. It transforms raw, noisy, and incomplete transactional data—containing over 15% missing values in several fields—into a refined, structured dataset ready for analysis and modeling. The objective of this pipeline is to understand customer behavior, analyze subscription patterns, and build machine learning models that predict subscription duration and revenue for SaaS businesses.

Data Analysis, Feature Engineering & Model Development

The workflow includes extensive data preprocessing, imputation of high-missing-value fields, and the creation of 10+ engineered features such as customer age, subscription duration, churn status, and derived financial metrics. It performs 20+ exploratory visualizations to analyze churn trends, revenue distribution, demographic patterns, and usage behavior. Two predictive models—Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor—are trained and evaluated using R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE. The output includes cleaned datasets, trained model files, visual insights, and prediction-ready pipelines suitable for deployment through Streamlit.

Project Impact — Complete ML Lifecycle Implementation

This project reduces data loss by effectively handling 15%+ missing information, improves prediction performance using engineered business features, and automates nearly 90% of the manual analysis steps typically performed by analysts. It identifies high-value customers, reveals churn triggers, highlights subscription behavior trends, and provides accurate forecasts of subscription revenue. By covering the full data lifecycle—from ingestion to insights to machine learning predictions—it demonstrates strong capability in building scalable and production-ready ML solutions.
